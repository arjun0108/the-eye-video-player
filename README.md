# the-eye-video-player

## Overview

### **"the-eye"** Video Player is an open source project on HTML5 Video Player.

**Note** - Please raise issues if you find any. It would be a great help for me to improve this project.


## See it in action

To see the video player in action, change the **source** of the video in the file **index.html**. Or you can use a simple way, add any video (e.g. - myVideo.mp4) to the **vid** folder and then directly write the name of the file like : 
```
<source src="vid/myVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
```
